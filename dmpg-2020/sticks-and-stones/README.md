basically some dude has N stones
he has a S by S grid in which he will place these N stones, and we're given the x and y coordinates
he also has infinite sticks of infinite length
he wants to have a stick on top of every rock
but he fears that his infinite supply of sticks might run out
so he wants you to find the least amount of sticks he has to use to cover all rocks
he cant put the sticks diagonally because god forbid that shit, only horizontally and vertically
    - or maybe he can? solution could involve having sets of slopes or something.
