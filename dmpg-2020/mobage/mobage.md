Nova is playing the hit new mobile gacha game (otherwise known as a mobage) "Knights of Ark"! He has a unit that he wants to "dummy link", making it stronger; however, each dummy link costs a certain amount of "Saint Quartz". He can dummy link a unit a maximum of 4 times. Assuming the first dummy link costs ~N~ Saint Quartz, then the costs for the subsequent links are:
```
2nd = N
3rd = 2N
4th = 3N
```
Given the cost for the first dummy link, please output the total amount of Saint Quartz Nova needs to fully dummy link his unit.

# Input Specification
A single integer, ~N (1 \le N \le 10^9)~, the cost of the first link.

# Output Specification
The total number of Saint Quartz required to dummy link the unit 4 times.
