![Stalin Sort: Origins.](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/368106422279471104/506435354623213579/x9triplll1v11.png)

Our great leader, Stalin, is in need of an efficient sorting algorithm. He wishes for us, Russia's greatest hackers, to create this sorting algorithm for him. However, as he is a busy man, he is not content with just any sorting algorithm. He has no time for numbers which are not in order, and demands that our sorting algorithm eliminate all such radicals. 

Write a sorting algorithm that takes in ~N~ numbers and sorts them in ascending order according to Stalin's requirements.

## Input Specification For Our Sorting Algorithm
The first line of input for our sorting algorithm will be an integer, ~N (1<=N<=100 000)~.

The remaining ~N~ lines of input for our sorting algorithm will contain the numbers for us to sort.

## Output Specification For Our Sorting Algorithm
Your sorting algorithm should print the sorted numbers in ascending order each on one line, with all elements out of order eliminated.
