Riko and Reg are descending the abyss, a mysterious chasm that is ~N~ kilometers deep. They will descend using Reg's extending metal arm; however, it has a few limitations. It has ~M~ different modes, with the ~i~th mode allowing them to descend ~M_i~ kilometers (each mode can be used infinite times). Also, it can only descend, and not ascend. They would like to know the number of ways they can descend to the bottom of the abyss. Write a program that outputs the number of scenarios in which they can reach the bottom, or `Stay home` if they cannot reach the bottom.

# Input Specification
The first line will contain two integers, ~N (1 \le 10^9 \le N)~ and ~M (1 \le 10^6 \le M)~ .
The second line will contain ~M~ integers, Reg's different modes.

# Output Specification
The number of ways Riko and Reg can reach the bottom, or `Stay home` if they cannot reach the bottom.
