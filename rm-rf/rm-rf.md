Oh no! [user:AQT] was too trusting and ran a *certain* command that a *certain someone* on Discord told him to run, and as a result has lost all the files and folders on his computer, leaving him with only his root folder ('/')! However, he doesn't really mind, since all he had saved onto his computer were solutions to problems on the popular online judge known as ðŸ…±MOJ which stores his submissions online anyways. He now has the tedious task of recreating all of his folders, and would like to know how much folders he must create in total.
